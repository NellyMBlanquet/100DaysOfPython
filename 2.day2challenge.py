# Summary:
# This program interacts with the user by asking for their name, favorite food, music preference, and place of residence.
# The responses are stored in variables and later printed in sentences to create a personalized message.
# Using 'input' allows dynamic interaction, and 'print' outputs information to the screen.
# Proper variable naming makes the code clear and readable.
