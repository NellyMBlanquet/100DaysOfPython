    I'm signing up for the 100 days of Python challenge!
    I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along,
    for a minimum of 10 minutes a day.
    I'll be guided by Replit's 100 Days of Python challenge and using VSC and Thonny as my IDEs.
    I'm excited to see where this journey will take me ðŸ˜Ž!
