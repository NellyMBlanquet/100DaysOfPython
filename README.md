# 100 Days of Python Challenge

## Based on Replit's 100 Days of Code

### Description

This repository contains the exercises, projects, and examples completed during the 100 Days of Python Challenge, inspired by Replit's 100 Days of Code. Each day, a new activity is added, complete with detailed explanations, code snippets, and reflections on the concepts learned.

- [Day 1 Challenge](1.day1challenge.py)
- [Day 2: User interaction with `input()`](#day-2-user-interaction-with-input)
- [Day 2 Challenge](2.day2challenge.py)

### Day 1
#### Introduction and the `print()` Function
On Day 1, we covered the basics of Python syntax and the `print()` function. We explored how to display text and simple expressions in Python, setting a foundation for future coding challenges.

### Day 2
#### User Interaction with `input()`
On Day 2, we learned how to create interactive programs by using the `input()` function, which allows us to collect user input from the keyboard. The `input()` function pauses program execution until the user enters a response and presses Enter. We stored these responses in variables, which allowed us to personalize the output using the `print()` function.

#### Key Concepts Covered
- The `input()` function: Collects user input and stores it in a variable for later use.
- Variables: Used to store dynamic data from the user.
- Print Statements with Variables: Displaying dynamic content by combining strings and variables.
- String Concatenation: Creating more personalized output by combining strings and variable values.

### Conclusion

This README will document your progress, serving both as a guide for your learning journey and as a reference for anyone who wants to follow along with the challenge. Remember, consistency is key! Happy coding, and enjoy the journey of learning with Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge!
