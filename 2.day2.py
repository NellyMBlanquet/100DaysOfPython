# The 'input' function is used to get user input from the keyboard.
# It pauses the program and waits for the user to type something and press Enter.
input("Name: ")  # This line asks for input but does not store it in a variable.

# A variable is a container for storing data values.
# 'myName' stores the name entered by the user.
myName = input("What is your name?: ")  

# 'myAge' stores the age entered by the user.
myAge = input("How old are you?: ")  

# 'print' outputs text to the screen.
print("Gee, that's really old ")  

# 'this' stores the user's response to a question.
this = input("How do you find this exercise? ")   

# Displaying a fixed response to the previous input.
print("Of course you do! ")  

# Printing an empty line for better readability.
print()  

# Printing multiple pieces of information in separate lines.
print("So you are")  
print(myName)  # Displays the name the user entered.
print("and the ripe old age of")  
print(myAge)  # Displays the age the user entered.
print("and clearly think this is")  
print(this)  # Displays the user's response to "Do you like this?"

# Naming convention:
# - Variable names should not contain spaces.
# - CamelCase (e.g., MyVariable) or snake_case (e.g., my_variable) are commonly used.
# - Using clear and descriptive names makes the code more readable.

# Summary:
# This program interacts with the user by asking for their name, age, and opinion.
# It stores user input in variables and later prints a summary of their responses.
# The 'input' function captures user data, while 'print' displays it.
# Proper variable naming helps keep the code organized and readable.
