# 100 Days of Python Challenge

## Based on Replit's 100 Days of Code

### Description

This repository contains the exercises, projects, and examples completed during the 100 Days of Python Challenge, inspired by Replit's 100 Days of Code. Each day, a new activity is added, complete with detailed explanations, code snippets, and reflections on the concepts learned.

### Day 1
#### [Introduction and the `print()` Function](1.day1.py)
On Day 1, we covered the basics of Python syntax and the `print()` function. We explored how to display text and simple expressions in Python, setting a foundation for future coding challenges.

### Day 2
#### [User Interaction with `input()`](2.day2.py)
On Day 2, we learned how to create interactive programs by using the `input()` function, which allows us to collect user input from the keyboard. The `input()` function pauses program execution until the user enters a response and presses Enter. We stored these responses in variables, which allowed us to personalize the output using the `print()` function.

### Day 3 
#### [User Input and String Combination in Python](3.day3.py)
On Day 3, we explored how to ask for user input with input() and how to combine different values in a print() statement.
Key Concepts:
Using input() to receive user input.
Combining strings in print() using commas ,.
